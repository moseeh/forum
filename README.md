## Objectives

This project is a web forum with the following functionality:

- **Communication between users**: Users can interact by creating posts and comments.
- **Image Upload**: Users can also interact by uploading images to the posts they are trying to make.
- **Categorization of posts**: Posts can be associated with one or more categories.
- **Likes and dislikes**: Users can like or dislike posts and comments, with the counts visible to everyone.
- **Filtering posts**: Posts can be filtered by categories, user-created posts, and liked posts.

## SQLite

SQLite is used to store the forum's data (e.g., users, posts,likes, dislikes, comments). It is an embedded database software ideal for local storage in application software.

### Notes:

SQLite enables creating and controlling a database using queries. To learn more about SQLite, visit the [SQLite documentation](https://sqlite.org/).

## Authentication

The forum supports user authentication, including:

### Registration:

- **Email**:
  - Collecting an email address during registration.
  - If the email is already in use, error response is returned.
- **Username**:
  - Collecting a unique username.
- **Password**:
  - Collecting a password and optionally encrypt it when stored.

### Login:

- The forum verifies if the provided email exists in the database and check if the credentials are correct.

### Sessions:

- Use of **cookies** to manage user sessions.

## Likes and Dislikes
